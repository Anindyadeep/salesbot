Modular structure allows for point solutions while providing flexibility for future transformation.   BuildSingle system of record for data, features,models and policiesIntegrated risk decisioning system   EvaluateStrategy design/change management systematically on platformReal time evaluation and comparison of models/policies   ApproveDynamic review and approval workflow with minimal exceptionsIntegrated staging and deployment environmentsDirect to Production   ValidateContinuous tracking of actual resultsTimely validation of performance projectionsAutomated alerts for exceptions Connected DesignThe platform establishes full connectivity between data – features – models & policies.Connected work benches allow for quick collaboration across teams by automating manual hand-offs.Built in traceability and lineage allows for full auditability. Integrated GovernancePlatform establishes transparent compliance and regulatory requirements across data/features/models/policies.End-to-End permissible use tracking of data as well as monitoring of models and policies.Centralized and standardized approval process to significantly reduce compliance violations. Democratized DecisioningBusiness teams can write rules and policies simply without need to interact with technology or modeling teams.Experiment, compare and approve policies centrally with clear business impact assessment.Rapidly deploy finalized policies to production directly without technology recoding. Ease of Integration Corridor has developed two environments, the Analytical environment for building policies & Production artifact as a standalone object that integrates easily into banks production environment. Analytical: Connects only with the data lake to extract metadatawithout complex integration into banks. Production: The production artifact is self-contained python artifact with all definitions required for policy scoring that integrates via API’s or direct function call into banks production system.
